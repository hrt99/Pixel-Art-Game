# Pixel-Art-Game
I have created this project by using Html, CSS, and Javascript. I have collaborated then and created a Pixel Art web page in which we can create many beautiful Pixel Arts. Earlier I divided the pixels into 33*33 dimensions but soon I realized that it would be better if I increase its dimensions,so you might see more pixels when you open my project. I also thought of using more colors so that there will be more choices. I also realized that it is hard to create art just by clicking so I researched and added Dragover function by which if we want to color more pixels then we can simply drag any particular color pixel and then color other pixels.
